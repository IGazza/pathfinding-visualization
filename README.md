# Pathfinding visualization
A Javascript program that provides a visualization of various path finding algorithms.

## Introduction
This application provides a step-by-step visualization of pathfinding algorithms. A user interface is provided to allow alteration of the grid that the path must traverse, including the start/end point, obstacles and visualization step speed.

## Usage
To use the application, simply clone the repo and then load the index.html file into your favourite browser.

## Configuration
The index.js file contains the necessary code to start the application, and provides a default configuration.
You can alter the start/end point by selecting that paint-mode in the tile UI.
Obstacles may also be added and removed when the obstacle paint-mode is selected. Left-click to add a new obstacle and Right-click to remove the currently hovered obstacle.
